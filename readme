This is the README file for the RTF package, an RTF reader/writer for
GNU Emacs.

This package is incomplete and in a very early stage of
development. DO NOT USE IT!

				 ***

If you are curious, the makefile is crappy, but it works. You need to
ajust your ‘load-path’ after that and ‘(require 'rtf)’. Byte
compilation is *strongly* recommended.

At compile time you also need the library state-m.el in the “lib”
directory. (It is written by me, but it is in “lib”, because it is a
separate package, which has nothing to do with RTF directly.)

				 ***

There is no real user interface, so far.  For testing I use the
following two functions:

‘rtf-test-read’ prompts for an RTF file and reads it into the
variable ‘rtf-test-var’. This is useful for examining the output of
the reader, for example in M-x ielm.

Please note, that reading currently produces *A LOT* of garbage.
Garbage collection may take up to a minute and more on my system (1500
MHz, 256 MB RAM).  So do not be surprised.  I am going to postpone
fixing this until a very late stage of development.

‘rtf-test-eval’ creates a new buffer named “*tmp*”, sets it to
‘rtf-major-mode’, evaluates the value of ‘rtf-test-var’ thereby
inserting text into “*tmp*”.

The directory “samples” contains a collection of RTF files which I am
using for testing.
